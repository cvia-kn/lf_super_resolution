Hi Anna,

I modified the last version:

1. create 3D encoder for HS and V channels. Variables creation and dense layer construction are compressed into the create_3D_encoder

2. create 2D decoder: Variables creation, symmetrical decoder layers and final upscaling layers

3. input becomes again the whole image with 3 channels, they are no longer separated in the 'create_HSV_training_data_v1'. The separation is done in the encoding,   decoding and setup loss procedures.

4. in config I set ids to layouts so that when different encoder/decoder are being created, the correct layout can be used.

5. I tested the variable and layer creation, they were fine. But at 'prepare_net_input()', I got no idea how to define some of them. That is where I got stuck. You can see the screen shots.

6. to create traing data, you need to use the 'create_HSV_training_data_v1'
